### Amount of protein to use
* ACS assays:
  * 5/5/2015: linear w/ 0.3 uM ACS & 3mM ADH, but doesn't deplete NADH over 1 hour
* ADH assays:

### Reagent concentrations
 
## NADH
* the plate reader signal loses linearity above about 1mM for 1/2-area plates w/ 120uL of solution
* Assays may be more linear at ~0.5mM NADH

## Amount of cofactors to use

### Tips
* Use of UV-transparent plastic enhances the range at which you can monitor over
  * Polystyrene has background absorbance of ~____nm.
* 

### Other resources
* Function to read plate reader data into R for better plotting: (in progress)
