ur extra culture (beyond what fits into the ultra) into 50mL tubes and consider pooling it.

Resuspend cells in ~20mL.  This will be ~40mL after you scrape the cell pellets in.  Scrape cell pellets into an 50mL tube using a scoop from the media room.  Don't try to resuspend bottle by bottle. Vortex after all the globs are in the falcon tube.  Don't want more than ~40mL total 

French press: always start with water.  Make sure you screw in ball after taking out the plunger.  And make sure it is screwed in before adding liquid cultures.  ~50mL lead to some leaking out the top.  Try again with water next time? 

Make sure there isn't blue stuff left in the column lid after binding.  Need to get that into the column if so! 

Tape the 50mL tube rack to something heavy.  Def want to tape so I won't knock it over and break the column's glass! 

General:
Avoid getting the filter wet on the pipettor.
