title: ADH purification using liters of culture
category: protein
---


ur extra culture (beyond what fits into the ultra) into 50mL tubes and consider pooling it.

Resuspend cells in ~20mL.  This will be ~40mL after you scrape the cell pellets in.  Scrape cell pellets into an 50mL tube using a scoop from the media room.  Don't try to resuspend bottle by bottle. Vortex after all the globs are in the falcon tube.  Don't want more than ~40mL total 

French press: always start with water.  Make sure you screw in ball after taking out the plunger.  And make sure it is screwed in before adding liquid cultures.  ~50mL lead to some leaking out the top.  Try again with water next time? 

Make sure there isn't blue stuff left in the column lid after binding.  Need to get that into the column if so! 

Tape the 50mL tube rack to something heavy.  Def want to tape so I won't knock it over and break the column's glass! 

General:
Avoid getting the filter wet on the pipettor.

solution | typical volumes | comments | amt to load in SDS-PAGE
---------------|-------------
lysate | 20mL | Want to be able to vortex in a 50mL tube so try to keep final volume < 40mL by using < 20mL resuspension buffer | __uL of 20X diluted sample   
washes | 10mL | washing strips some ADH off of column so don't wash excessively | 10uL
elutions | 1.5mL - 4mL | chose smaller volumes if you want to get a few fractions with really high concentrations. | 8-16 uL*uM  

## Grow cultures
* Day 1: Restreak -80oC stock onto an LB + Km plate
	* Strain 78: pET29b ALD 3K9D from Amanda.  Pink tube.  Always check description on the side of the tube, and use an unopened streaking tip tube for -80oC stocks. 
		* [-80oC stock spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlVxrZi130nMdHlsaml2OGFDUW9zRlVBdkRKaXVEbkE#gid=11)

* Day 2: Prepare inoculum and liters of autoinduction media
	* Inoculate 1-5 colonies into an overnight flask with LB + Km 
	* Prepare autoinduction media: [recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EM-sfk65Xf5F3q3316Yw_b5y0U5GasYQLF6Ug5sa7Y8/edit#gid=0)
		* Weigh ingredients into 2.8L flasks, add millipore DI H2O, cover with foil and autoclave tape, and autoclave. 
	* Weigh out Km to be dissolved and filter sterilized directly into flasks. 
		* AMT ______
* Day 3: Inoculate big flasks
	* Finish preparing autoinduction media:
		* ADD SUGAR MIX TO AUTOINDUCTION MEDIA. 40mL per liter of culture. 
		* Resuspend the Kanamycin and syring filer it into the flasks
		* Inoculate the flasks with ~10mL of overnight culture per liter of autoinduction media base

## Centrifuge in the Sorvoll floor centrifuge
## French press in the large french press cell
## Clairify lysates in the Sorvoll 
## Prepare resin
## Load clairified lysate onto resin
## Wash loaded resin
## Elute ADH from the resin
## Quantify uMs via NanoDrop A280 readings
## Pool desirable elutions
## Flash freeze and store at -80oC
