## Pouring your own SDS-PAGE gel
* Janet will handle this for the forseeable future.

## Pre-run SDS-PAGE gel if hand-poured
* There is some sort of salt front that messes up low MW bands in our hand-poured gels, but pre-running the gel for 30 minutes solves the problem.
* Load the gel with fresh or fresh-ish 1X buffer, and run for ~30 min at 200V to solve the problem.

## Preparing samples
* Decide how much sample to load per well
  * Often it is useful to load a few different concentrations so you are likely to get a loading that is informative (not under or over loaded).

protein source | amt. to load| comments
---------------|-------------
total cell protein (lysed & spun down | 5-8 or even 20ug per well (mini protean 10-well comb) |
cell cultures (total protein) | ~5-8 uL of turbid TB E. coli for skinny wells.  Becomes 10uL after adding 4X buffer |
purified protein | 4-8 uL\*uM | works well for ~50-70kDa protein. | 
purified protein | ~40ng | So minimum concentration is ~5ng/uL. If stock is  Good for ~50-70kDa proteins.   

## Decide how much excess to prepare
* Planning what you will load each lane in advance is helpful for this.
* If the protein isn't precious, make a few times more than is required so you can re-run if necessary.

## Prepare samples
* Use Janet's home-made 4X loading dye.  Before use, add 4% by volume beta mercaptoethanol (b-ME) so the final sample will have 1%. 
  * Prepare a little excess (~10%)
* Add loading dye to samples in PCR tubes
* Boil for 5 min on a thermocycler
  * 100oC for 5 minutes

## Run gel
* Janet has been pre-running the gel for 15 min at 60V, but I'm not convinced this is necessary.
* Run at 200V for ~30 min, check gel, then keep running until the band you want to detect is near the bottom of the gel.  
  * ACS is ~ 74.5 kDa 
  * ADH 3K9D is ~ 49 kDa
  * The ladder we usually use is PageRuler Prestained.  

## Wash & Stain gel
* Wash SDS (soap) out of the gel by taking it out of the plates, and putting it in a tupperware of fresh DI water.  
  * Let stand ~10 min for equilibrium.  Repeat 3 times.  Insufficient washing --> whole gel stains & you can't see where the bands are.
