## Pouring your own SDS-PAGE gel
* Janet will handle this for the forseeable future.   

## Pre-run SDS-PAGE gel if hand-poured
* There is some sort of salt front that messes up low MW bands in our hand-poured gels, but pre-running the gel for 30 minutes solves the problem. 
* Load the gel with fresh or fresh-ish 1X buffer, and run for ~30 min at 200V to solve the problem. 

## Preparing samples
* Decide how much sample to load per well
  * Often it is useful to load a few different concentrations so you are likely to get a loading that is informative (not under or over loaded). 
### Total Cell Protein (lysed & spun down)
* Load 5-8 or even up to 20ug per well. (for Mini Protean with 10 well comb)
### Cell Cultures (total protein)
* 7.5 uL of turbid TB E. coli is about right for skinny wells. This becomes 10uL after adding 4X buffer.
### Purified protein:
* ~40 ng seems about right. -JM
  * This means the minimum concentration is ~5ng/uL. When you load 7.5uL in the skinny-comb gels (becomes 10uL after adding 4X buffer) you get ~40 ng in the gel.
* 4 to 8 uL*uM works well for ~50-70kDa enzymes. If the stock is 1uM, add 4-8uL. If it is 4uM, add 1-2uL. *JM 20 August 2014

## Decide how much excess to prepare
* Planning what you will load each lane in advance is helpful for this.
* If the protein isn't precious, make a few times more than is required so you can re-run if necessary.
