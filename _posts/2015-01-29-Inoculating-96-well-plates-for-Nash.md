title: Inoculating 96-well plates for Nash assay  
category: enzyme_assays
---

## Overview

## Tips
* sterilize stuff in the hood before 
* Be careful to never have the block upside down when inoculating or withdrawing fluid
* Be careful not to rotate your wrist and reverse the A-H order when moving fluid from one 96-well plate to another
* Avoid touching the top grid on the 96-well plate.  We don't want cells from one well to hop into an adjacent well.  Think of this as keeping the doormat to a house clean so you don't get dirt inside. 

## Things that can be done at "waiting steps":

## Prepare previous day(s):
* A plan of what you are trying to test
	* Just screening new random library variants?
	* Are there old colonies that need to be re-tested? 
	* Do some samples need to be run with biological replicates? 
* Plates with low enough colony density for picking colonies
* sterile toothpicks
* A 96-well plan with a color-coded cartoon of the pattern you are creating

## Bring to the sterile hood: 
* A printout of the exact pattern you plan to inoculate the plate with
* 96-well deep blocks
* reverse tweezers
* scissors
* multichannel 1mL pipette
* autoclaved toothpicks
* control and test cells
* media with antibiotics 
* 1mL tips
* something sterile to put media in
* breathable sticker(s)
* sharpie(s) 
* ethanol

## First steps
* (optional) put everything except bacteria (and media?) in the UV hood and sterilize it by applying UV light
	* bacteria shouldn't be put under UV light.  I believe UV light penetrates the plastic we use
	* antibiotics in media might not withstand the UV light, so lets avoid exposing it. 
* Label the plate with the date of inoculation and the plate number if multiple are being created
	* Use the H-row side of the block.  Consistency will reduce errors.
* Label A-H on the right side of the block  

## Inoculate controls
* The high activity + control is inoculated on the diagonal running from A1 to H8.  Some extra positions may be included. 

## Inoculate non-control wells

## Wrapping up
* Note on your paper printout the wells that were busted.  Examples include:
** inoculated with two different cell types 
* Note in the gSpreadsheet which wells should be discarded from analysis.
