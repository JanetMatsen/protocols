## Grow cells
* decide between pET and pTrc
* decide source of overnight cultures
* prepare media:
  * decide TB vs LB
  * include antibiotics: (2uL/mL for Amp, 1uL/mL if Kan)

* Inoculate overnights.  Inoculate at least 1mL of overnight per 50mL of culture.  Use 50mL falcon tube.
* Include antibiotis

## Prepare Buffers
* Decide amounts to make
  * Make a few times more than you need

## Prepare columns
* chose a method of holding up the column

* chose a method of pulling liquid through the column when it is slow.
  * flow through the column is slow when there is a bubble or when the solution is viscous.
  * you can use a 1mL pipette tip to pull solution through the bottom, use a centrifuge in a 15mL falcon tube, or use "the pig."
* pipette in resin
* let buffer drain
  * buffer contains 20% ethanol and should be flushed
* rinse resin by applying 1mL of NaCl PO4 buffer
* firmly place yellow caps at the bottom opening before loading samples
* load lysed samples
