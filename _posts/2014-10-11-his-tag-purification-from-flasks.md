## Grow cells
* decide between pET and pTrc
* decide source of overnight cultures
  * fresh transform?  reasonly recent old transform?  -80oC stock?
* prepare media:
  * decide TB vs LB.  TB may give higher OD and/or [protein/cell]
  * include antibiotics: (2uL/mL for Amp, 1uL/mL if Kan)
* Day 1: Inoculate overnights.  Inoculate at least 1mL of overnight per 50mL of culture.  Use 50mL falcon tube.
  * Consider preparing media in large flask(s)
* Inoculate flasks (Day 2).
  * Use up to 1mL of overnight per 50mL of culture you are inoculating.
  * More inoculum --> less time until cells should be induced.
* Thaw 1M IPTG stock from -20oC by moving it to the fridge.
* Induce to 0.5mM IPTG using 1M stocks at -20oC when cells reach OD ~0.6 - 1
  * Use NanoDrop to measure ODs, so **OD_NanoDrop = 0.06 - 0.1**, NOT 0.6 - 1 like you would look for in flasks.
  * &#x25a2; Save NanoDrop data as tables in the project folder on the Z drive as you go.  The ODs at induction are the most important
* Collect cells by centrifugation
  * Chill centrifuge w/ 50mL tube rotor to 4oC.
  * Label 50mL falcon tubes: date, your intials, the sample info, and the mL of culture being collected into the tube
* Drain the 50mL falcon tubes upside down to remove excess broth.  
* Flash freeze cells (optional)
  * Use -20oC for short-term (days/weeks) storage, and -80oC for long term storage.

## Prepare Buffers
* Buffer currently in use:
  * 50mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.
* Decide amounts to make
  * Make a few times more than you need.  Excess buffer can be used for subsequent purifications.
  * Use spreadsheet aid volume planning
* &#x25a2; Verify that you have basic PO4 buffer, PO4 + NaCl buffer, lysis buffer, salty wash buffer, unsalty wash buffer, elution buffer.

## Begin lysis
* If you are making a batch of lysis buffer, add 1 part 10X BugBuster to 9 parts NaCl PO4 buffer.  (10X --> 1X) 
* Add an appropriate amount of NaCl PO4 1X BugBuster to each 50mL falcon tube
* Put on rocker with maximum tilt and speed set to ___.
** Too fast might shear the DNA & break it.  Not sure if that is really bad, but could elute and increase the A280 measurement. 
** Try to prop up the cap side of the tubes so the liquid hits the whole pellet each time it sloshes to the pellet side of the tube
  *Check whether pellet is dissolving every ~20 minutes.  Vortex lightly if pellet is remaining stuck to the bottom of the tube.

## Clarify Lysates 
* Lysates are spun down to get rid of insoluble material including whole cells and membranes
* Cool the centrifuge to 4oC with the eppendorf rotor in place
* Label 2mL eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL also works) you will use to load the samples.  For every ~5mL of lysis buffer use ~4 eppendorf tubes.
* Load lysates into eppendorf tubes
* Spin at max RPM (14000?) for 30 minutes.  
** It is better to set the centrifuge to spin indefinitely.  If the centrifuge stops for a while, the pellets may get loose and the lysate will un-clarify to some extent.

## Prepare columns
* Chose a column size
  * the lysate volume is the most important parameter.  If in doubt, chose the [largest ones] (http://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/poly-prep-chromatography-columns?pcp_loc=catprod). 
* chose a method of holding up the column
  * <img src="/protocols/images/141008_use_tube_rack_to_hold_tall_columns.jpg" height="200">
* chose a method of pulling liquid through the column when it is slow.
  * flow through the column is slow when there is a bubble or when the solution is viscous.
  * you can use a 1mL pipette tip to pull solution through the bottom, use a centrifuge in a 15mL falcon tube, or use "the pig."
* pipette in resin
* let buffer drain
  * buffer contains 20% ethanol and should be flushed
*  &#x25a2;rinse resin by applying 1mL of NaCl PO4 buffer
* firmly place yellow caps at the bottom opening before loading samples
* load lysed samples (described below)

## Load protein onto washed resin 
* Load the clear portion of the centrifuged lysats.  Avoid distrubing the cell pellet, and any goopy stuff at the bottom near the pellet. 
* Place the clear cap on firmly
