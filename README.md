protocols
=========

protocols used in my PhD thesis

## Use notes:
* to see how the web will show the current version of your protocols, run the shell script ./local.sh
  * You must be in that folder.  You can't do ../local.sh
* categories need to be specified in the post/document and in index.md.  To make a new category, make a copy of the protein category & give it a new name.
